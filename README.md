# Introduction

This is my collection of vim plugins and settings. This README file will describe what each plugin does.

## Download

    cd ~/.vim
    git clone git@github.com:fersho311/songVimPlugins.git

## Pathogen (most important)

pathogen.vim makes it super easy to install plugins and runtime files in their own private directories. 
Without pathogen, your vim plugins may get messy and unmanageable. Removing a plugin will be a pain because you have to manually remove all the files associated with it. With pathogen, every plugin resides in its own folder.

## EasyMotion

EasyMotion makes navigation around the current buffer really easy. If you want to jump to a specific word, trigger EasyMotion(\\w) and select the highlighted character. It is much easier than search or jump through rows and words

## AutoComplPop

This is an awesome brain-rotter! It auto completes for you as you type used in editors like dreamweaver, espresso, xcode.
